# Introduction

### Welcome to the cTrader OpenAPI Community Docs! 🎉

This site is built by developers, for developers who work with the cTrader
OpenAPI. If you want to connect to your cTrader account, stream live market
data, or build your own trading bots and dashboards, you're in the right place.

#### Here you'll find:

- 📖 Easy-to-follow guides and code snippets
- 🛠️ Best practices and lessons learned from the community
- 💻 Workarounds, tips, and extra details not always covered in the official
  docs

#### Official resources:

- 🔹[Official cTrader OpenAPI Docs](https://help.ctrader.com/open-api/)
- 🔹[Spotware GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/spotware)
- 🔹[Official cTrader OpenAPI Telegram Group](https://t.me/ctrader_open_api_support)

Our goal is to make it easier and faster for you to build what you need with the
cTrader OpenAPI. These docs are not official, but are meant to complement the
official ones with extra examples, explanations, and community insights.

👉 New here? Start with the
[Getting Started guide](https://help.ctrader.com/open-api/#getting-started) to
gain a basic understanding about the API, and then
[Contacting the API](./contacting-api/) to set up your first API connection and
more, or head over to the [Examples](./examples) section to dive right in. You
can also go to the [Playground](https://m-ahmadi.github.io/ctoa-play/) for
exploring the API using an interactive interface.
