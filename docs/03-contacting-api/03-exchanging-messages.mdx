# Exchanging Messages

Once we [established a connection](./establishing-connection), we can send a
message to the server. You might be wondering what we mean by a message and how
are we going to send it.

## WebSocket Basics

In order to better understand the mechanism of sending messages, let's forget
about the cTrader OpenAPI server for the moment and connect to another server.

The endpoint that we're going to connect to is `'wss://echo.websocket.org'`.
This is what's called an echo server, meaning, whatever message the client
sends, it will send the exact same message back to the client.

Once the connection is open, we start sending the messages. Notice that we're
now "listening" for messages that server is sending back.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="JavaScript">

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://echo.websocket.org');

// util functions
const { log } = console;
const sleep = (secs) => new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, secs * 1000));

ws.onopen = function () {
  log('connected to server');

  let msg = 'hello';
  ws.send(msg);
  log('client sent a message:', msg);

  msg = 'hi';
  ws.send(msg);
  log('client sent a message:', msg);
};

ws.onmessage = function (event) {
  const serverMsg = event.data;
  log(`server sent a message: ${serverMsg}`);
};

(async () => {
  while (true) await sleep(0.25);
})();
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Python">

```py

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Results from running the code:

```
connected to server
client sent a message: hello
client sent a message: hi
server sent a message: hello
server sent a message: hi
```

### Underlying Type of Messages

Let's focus for a moment to the type of messages that are being exchanged, i.e.
the messages sent by client to server or vice versa.

Let's only change some parts of previous code example and run it again.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="JavaScript">

```js
ws.onopen = function () {
  console.log('connected to server');
  ws.send('hello');
  ws.send(2573);
  ws.send(true);
};

ws.onmessage = function (event) {
  const serverMsg = event.data;
  const msgType = typeof serverMsg;
  console.log(`server sent a message: ${serverMsg} (${msgType})`);
};
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Python">

```py

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Results from running the code:

```
connected to server
server sent a message: hello (string)
server sent a message: 2573 (string)
server sent a message: true (string)
```

As you see, even when we're sending a message with the type of `number` or
`int`, what the server sends back is always `string` or `str`. This is
notewortyh because it demonstrates that messages being exchanged between client
and server are (usually) strings. Techincally, there are
[other types of messages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/send#data)
that can be transmitted over the network, but in our case of cTrader OpenAPI
server, we deal only with strings.

## Format of Messages

So far, we established what a message is, and how to send one. Now let's shift
our focus back to the cTrader OpenAPI server and go back to the
[endpoint](./endpoints#an-example) we were using
[earlier](./establishing-connection), and let's listen again for incomeing
server messages.

Now let's send a message to the cTrader OpenAPI server, and see wha happens:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="JavaScript">

```js
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://live.ctraderapi.com:5036');

// util functions
const { log } = console;
const sleep = (secs) => new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, secs * 1000));

ws.onopen = function () {
  log('connected to server');
  ws.send('hello');
};

ws.onmessage = function (event) {
  const serverMsg = event.data;
  log(`server sent a message: ${serverMsg}`);
};

ws.onclose = function () {
  log('connection closed');
};

(async () => {
  while (true) await sleep(0.25);
})();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">

```py

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Results:

```
connected to server
server sent a message: {"payloadType":2142,"payload":{"errorCode":
                       "INVALID_REQUEST","description":"Malformed JSON message
                       at 1:6"}}
connection closed
```

You can see that server did respond to our message, but it sent a long text that
seems to have a format. That format is
[JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/JSON).
When we want to send a message to the server, we cannot just send any string
like `'hello'`. Our messages must have a format and a structure to them, exactly
like how server responded to us. So we established that our meessages need to be
in JSON format, but what's the structure then?

The message must be a JSON object with some fields. One of these fields is
`payloadType`, which is an integer number, and is a neccessary field that must
be present in all message. Another common (but not present in all messages) is
`payload`, which is another JSON object with its own fields.

The server only understands a
[pre-defined set of messages](./dictionary-of-all-messages), so by specifing the
`payloadType` field, your're telling the server which message you're trying to
send. Now we're able to select a specific message to send, but how would we send
extra information that a message may need to convey? That's what's the `payload`
field is for. What field(s) should the `payload` object have depends on what
`payloadType` is being send.

## Sending the First Message

The first message a client sends to server is a `payloadType` of `2100`, which
is called "Requesting application authentication". This message must have a
`payload` with two required fields, one is `clientId`, and the other is
`clientSecret`, and both fields must have string values which are part of the
credentials you must acquire to be able to identify yourself to the server. So
lets' send our firt proper message to the server.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="JavaScript">

```js
ws.onopen = function () {
  // ...
  const clientMsg = {
    payloadType: 2100,
    payload: {
      clientId: '127f2f93c5c36feeed22a97174ce1f03bee9a71892caf6efca447415',
      clientSecret: '32186df996aee51ab620852086f160ee67e36c7c673bd312b2',
    },
  };
  ws.send(clientMsg);
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">

```py

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Results from running the code:

```
connected to server
server sent a message: {"payloadType":2101}
```

As you see from the results, the server repsonds with a `payloadType` of `2101`,
which means success. We will cover this in more detail later, but for now you
should know that a `payloadType` that is one number greater than the one we send
means success, and a `payloadType` of `2142` means failure.
