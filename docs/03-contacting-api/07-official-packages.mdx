The official Python package uses a library for networking called
[Twisted](https://twisted.org/) under the hood. Altough Twisted is a very old
library and there are far better alternatives, you can still get a lot done with
it.

### Usage Code Example

```py
from ctrader_open_api import Client, Protobuf, TcpProtocol, EndPoints
import ctrader_open_api.messages.OpenApiMessages_pb2 as OA
import ctrader_open_api.messages.OpenApiModelMessages_pb2 as OAModel
import ctrader_open_api.messages.OpenApiCommonMessages_pb2 as OACommon
import ctrader_open_api.messages.OpenApiCommonModelMessages_pb2 as OAModelCommon
from twisted.internet import reactor

import json

credentials = json.load(open('credentials.json'))
client = Client(EndPoints.PROTOBUF_LIVE_HOST, EndPoints.PROTOBUF_PORT,
                TcpProtocol)

def main():
  print('ready to do something')
  reactor.stop()

def onAccAuth(message):
  print('account authenticated')
  main()

def onAppAuth(message):
  print('app authenticated')
  req = OA.ProtoOAAccountAuthReq()
  req.ctidTraderAccountId = credentials['accountId']
  req.accessToken = credentials['accessToken']
  deferred = client.send(req)
  deferred.addCallbacks(onAccAuth, onError)

def onError(failure):
  print('err: ', repr(failure.value))

def connected(client):
  print('connected')
  req = OA.ProtoOAApplicationAuthReq()
  req.clientId = credentials['clientId']
  req.clientSecret = credentials['clientSecret']
  deferred = client.send(req)
  deferred.addCallbacks(onAppAuth, onError)

def disconnected(client, reason):
  print('disconnected: ', reason)

def onMsg(client, message):
  ignores = [i.payloadType for i in [OACommon.ProtoHeartbeatEvent(),
	                                   OA.ProtoOAAccountAuthRes(),
																		 OA.ProtoOAApplicationAuthRes()]]
  if message.payloadType in ignores:
    return
  print('message received')

client.setConnectedCallback(connected)
client.setDisconnectedCallback(disconnected)
client.setMessageReceivedCallback(onMsg)
client.startService()
reactor.run()

```

### Correct Name of PyPi Package

The name of the package is actually `ctrader_open_api` (separated by underline),
but even if you use the name `ctrader-open-api` (separated by dash) to install
it, it would still work. The reason for this is because the dash characters get
automatically converted to underlines in the process. Since this could be a
source of confusion, it's worth covering it here.

Let's create an isolated environment and get a report of what packages would be
installed after running a `pip install` command (`--report` option), but without
actually installing anything (`--dry-run` option), and then compare the two
reports. So we install both a package named `ctrader_open_api`, and another
named `ctrader-open-api`, and will store the report into files.

```
mkdir test && cd test
python -m venv .env
.env\Scripts\activate
pip install ctrader_open_api --dry-run -I --report f1.json
pip install ctrader-open-api --dry-run -I --report f2.json
```

And the we examine the two report files like below:

```py
import json

def print_installed_pkgs(report_file)
  o = json.load(open(report_file, encoding='utf-8-sig'))
  a = [i['metadata']['name'] +'=='+ i['metadata']['version']
    for i in o['install']]
  print('\n'.join(a))

print('installed pkgs after `pip install ctrader_open_api`')
print_installed_pkgs_from_report_file('f1.json')
print('-------------------------')
print('installed pkgs after `pip install ctrader-open-api`')
print_installed_pkgs_from_report_file('f2.json')
```

As you can see below, both will install the same exact things.

```
installed pkgs after `pip install ctrader_open_api`
ctrader_open_api==0.9.2
inputimeout==1.0.4
protobuf==3.20.1
...
-------------------------
installed pkgs after `pip install ctrader-open-api`
ctrader_open_api==0.9.2
inputimeout==1.0.4
protobuf==3.20.1
...
