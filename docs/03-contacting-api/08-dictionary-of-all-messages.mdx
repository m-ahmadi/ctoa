# Dictionary of All Messages

Client and server can only send each other messages that they have previously
agreed upon. A message is nothing more than a number that's been assigned to a
way of sending/receiving data between client and server.

As we saw in [exchanging messages](./exchanging-messages), through the
`payloadType` field we can select a message to send to the server, and depending
on which message we select, the `payload` is expected to have certain fields.

Here we will see the entire messages that client and server can understand. In a
way these messages are the language of communication between client and server.
For more information about a message, check the
[API Reference](https://help.ctrader.com/open-api/messages/).

| Char | Meaning                                                                                |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ğŸ‘‰   | A message that client sends to server, requesting something.                           |
| ğŸ‘ˆ   | A message that server sends to client, (usually) in reponse to a client's request.     |
| ğŸ””   | A message that server sends to client without client specifically requesting anything. |

:::info

If a message has both ğŸ‘‰ and ğŸ‘ˆ, it means once you send the request message,
server will respond with a specific message addressing your request. In other
words, for every request, there is a response.

If a message only has a ğŸ‘‰, it means it's a type of message that doesn't have a
specific response from the server. (You just send the message and that's it).

## How Table Was Generated

```py
import ctrader_open_api.messages.OpenApiMessages_pb2 as OA

prefix = 'ProtoOA'
a = dir(OA)
b = [i.split(prefix)[1] for i in filter(lambda i: i.startswith(prefix), a)]

reqs = filter(lambda i: i.endswith('Req'), b)
ress = filter(lambda i: i.endswith('Res'), b)
evts = filter(lambda i: i.endswith('Event'), b)

def populate(d, a, cutend, mark):
  for k in a:
    name = k[:-cutend]
    if name not in d:
      d[name] = []
    d[name].append(mark)

d = {}
populate(d, reqs, 3, 'ğŸ‘‰')
populate(d, ress, 3, 'ğŸ‘ˆ')
populate(d, evts, 5, 'ğŸ””')


# generate markdown
rows = []
idxbychr = {'ğŸ‘‰':1,'ğŸ‘ˆ':2,'ğŸ””':3}
for k, v in d.items():
  row = [k,'','','']
  for i in v:
    row[ idxbychr[i] ] = i
  rows.append(row)
sort(rows, key=str)
markdown_rows = '\n'.join(map(lambda i: ' | '.join(i), rows))

print(markdown_rows)
```
