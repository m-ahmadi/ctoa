# Protobuf

So far we learned about the `JSON` format of messages that we were exchanging
with the server. There is also another format that we can use, and that is
`Protobuf`. One reason we started with `JSON` format, was that it's a simpler
approach, and therefore makes the code examples shorter, which in turn allows
the reader to focus more on the bigger picture being described. You might ask
then what's the point of using this other format. Let's start with a very basic
comparison table:

| Format     | Size  | Hassle of Using | When Makes Sense      |
| ---------- | ----- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| `JSON`     | Large | Almost None     | Small amount of users |
| `Protobuf` | Small | A Lot           | Large amount of users |

The messages in `Protobuf` format are much shorter in size compared to `JSON`,
and that results in less data being transmitted over the network. It might seem
that using the `Protobuf` is the absolute better choice, but it's not that
simple. One can argue against the use of `Protobuf` in some cases. Using
`Protobuf` makes more sense when there are multiple clients connecting to the
server, and by more we mean thousands and thousands more. Usualy if your program
has less than a 1000 clients, the difference between trafic being saved is not
worth the hassles of dealing with `Protobuf`. We later see an example of
comparing the size of messages in these two strucures and a way to roughly
calculate the amount of traffic base on the `RATE_LIMIT` concept.

`Protobuf` is a data interchange language developed by Google, and it has its
own syntax for defining data structures and rules and relationship between them.
The contents in this langauge are written in files with a `.proto` extension. In
order to use these files in a programming language, they must be compiled first,
and to do that we need to install its compiler.
