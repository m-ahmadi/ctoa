# API Endpoints

There are 4 pieces of detail about API endpoints:

1. Host of the endpoint
2. Port of the endpoint
3. Specific host designated base on account type
4. Specific port designated base on messaging type

Below table shows all the possible combinations:

| Host                  | Port   | Account Type | Messaging Format |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------ | ---------------- |
| `live.ctraderapi.com` | `5035` | Live         | Protobuf         |
| `demo.ctraderapi.com` | `5035` | Demo         | Protobuf         |
| `live.ctraderapi.com` | `5036` | Live         | JSON             |
| `demo.ctraderapi.com` | `5036` | Demo         | JSON             |

### An Example

Let's say you have a live account and you want to use JSON as the method of  
communication with the server. In that case, you should use below endpoint:

```
'live.ctraderapi.com:5036'
```
