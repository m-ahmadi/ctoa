# Acquiring Credentials

Once we are connected to the server, we can send a message to it, and the server
will respond to our message too, but the problem is because server does not know
who we are, it will respond to any message we send by sending an error message
back (`payloadType` of `2142`). In order to introduce ourself properly to the
server, we need to have the proper credentials, so let's see how we can get
them.

## How to Get ClientID, ClientSecret, AccessToken and RefreshToken

### Part 1: Getting **`ClientID`** and **`ClientSecret`**

1. Go to this page: https://openapi.ctrader.com/apps
2. Log-in with your cTrader account (if not already logged-in).
3. Click **`= Add new App`** button.
   1. Fill-in the mandatory fields: `Application name` and `Description`, etc.
   2. Click **`+ Add redirect URL`** and put **`https://example.com`**.
   3. Click **`Save`** and now your entry is created.
4. Click **`Credentials`** on created entry and there you have the `Client ID`
   and `Secret`.
5. Wait untill **`Status`** of created entry changes from **`Submitted`** to
   **`Active`**.  
   (might take up to 3 bussinus days)
6. So far we have the following pieces:

   ```
   REDIRECT_URI=...
   CLIENT_ID=...
   CLIENT_SECRET=...
   ```

### Part 2: Getting **`Authorization Code`**, **`AccessToken`** and **`RefreshToken`**

1. Must open below URL in browser:  
   https://id.ctrader.com/my/settings/openapi/grantingaccess/  
   with below query parameters:

   | Query Param     | Where Value Comes From |
   | --------------- | ---------------------- |
   | `redirect_uri=` | from Part 1, step 3.2  |
   | `client_id=`    | from Part 1, step 3.4  |

2. In opened page click **`Allow access`**

3. After clicking **`Allow access`**, you will be redirected to a URL that has a
   query parameter named **`code`**, save its value:

   ```
   CODE=...
   ```

4. Must open below URL: (in under 60 seconds of Part 2, step 1)  
   https://openapi.ctrader.com/apps/token?grant_type=authorization_code  
   with below query parameters:

   | Query Param      | Its Value                           |
   | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
   | `redirect_uri=`  | from Part 1, step 3.2               |
   | `client_id=`     | from Part 1, step 3.4               |
   | `client_secret=` | from Part 1, step 3.4               |
   | `code=`          | from previous step (Part 2, step 3) |

5. Now you have the **`AccessToken`** and **`RefreshToken`**

## How to Get AccountID

   2. Click **`Get token`**.
   3. Click **`Allow access`**.

cTrader account in `JSON` format.

You will have below properties for each trading account:

```json
