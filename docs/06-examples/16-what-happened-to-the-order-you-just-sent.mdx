# What happened to the order you just sent

if you want to check what happened to the order you must send
`ProtoOAOrderListReq`, then server sends back a list of orders, now in that list
you can find your order

you might ask well how can I find my order, well, there are two ways, one way is
that you can find it based on time of the order, which you can use the
`utcLastUpdateTimestamp` field of an order in the list of orders returned by
server

anoter way is to find it using a user-provided orderId, here you must provide a
`clientOrderId` field when you are sending the `ProtoOANewOrderReq` message,
this way you already know the id of the order that you want to find (in the list
of orders returned by the server)
