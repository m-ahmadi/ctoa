# Why live trendbar has no close price

A live trendbar doesn't have `deltaClose`  
the close in this case is the current `bid` and `ask`

You can think about it like this:

Because it's a live candle, the `close` keeps changing

Once you subscribe to `SpotEvent` (which you obviously did cuz server throws
error if you didnt) you get current bid ask values, use those as close

in the picture, each row is a server message, so the red box is your `close`
price

---

trendbar field is 1M candle of last minute without close (only has
open,high,low)

bid/ask fields are the last known price and they are the hypothetical/perpetual
close for the trendbar candle
