# Basic WebSocket example in JavaScript

https://t.me/ctrader_open_api_support/8186

Here's a little snippet to play with
[WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket).  
It's called an echo server, meaning, whatever you send to it  
it will send that exact thing back to you.

If you run below snippet (or paste it in the console of your browser),  
you will see a log like:  
`server sent you a message: hello`

```js
var ws = new WebSocket('wss://echo.websocket.org');

ws.onopen = function (e) {
  console.log('connected to server');
};
ws.onmessage = function (e) {
  console.log('server sent you a message:', e.data);
};
ws.onerror = function (e) {
  console.log('connection encountered an error');
};
ws.onclose = function (e) {
  console.log('connection closed', e.code, e.reason, e.wasClean);
};

ws.send('hello');
```

Now for example send another thing to server like

```js
ws.send('hi');
```

and you will see another log like  
`server sent you a message: hi`
