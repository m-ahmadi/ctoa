:::warning

The contents here are not meticulously organized (mostly copies of answers from
Telegram group), so you can find redundant code quite a lot.

This section contains practical code examples for working with the cTrader
OpenAPI . Each example is designed to be simple, focused, and ready to adapt
into your own projects.

You'll find snippets for common use cases, including:

- 🔑 Connecting and authenticating with the API
- 📊 Subscribing to real-time market data streams
- 💰 Placing, modifying, and closing orders
- 📈 Accessing account balances, positions, and history

Examples are provided in multiple programming languages where possible (e.g.,
JavaScript, Python, Go, C#). They are organized by topic so you can quickly find
what you need.

👉 If you're new to cTrader OpenAPI, we recommend starting with the
[Getting Started guide](https://help.ctrader.com/open-api/#getting-started)
